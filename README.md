This is my own project repository for my Walsh IT classes

Final Project Folder contains the IT 456 Final Project: Predicting Wildfires This dataset relates to the occurrence of wild fires, and has already been preprocessed to remove noise and correct inconsistencies, so you will not need to do that. This data, collected by NASA using remote sensors, contains parameters with high influence on the occurrence of wildfires.

The dataset has four columns:

NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which relates to crop conditions LST: Land Surface Temperature BURNED_AREA: Values related to thermal anomalies CLASS: This fourth column contains one of the two categories to predict: fire or no_fire. The first 3 columns are predictors, and they are all numeric. There is no missing data. The fourth column has string values, so you'll need to change those to numbers. There are only 1713 rows. Each row contains the three predictors and the category to predict.

The data covers multiple zones of approximately 2 million hectares located in the center of Canada. Canada's forests were chosen because this area is known for its high rate of wildfires and also for the availability of fire data from the Canadian Wild-land Fire Information System (CWFIS) which creates daily fire weather and fire behavior maps year-round and hot spot maps throughout the forest fire season.
